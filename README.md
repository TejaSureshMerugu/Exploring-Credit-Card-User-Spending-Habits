Exploring Credit Card User Spending Habits: A Data-Driven Analysis

This credit card data analysis study delves into the comprehensive exploration of credit card transaction data, presenting a multifaceted investigation that encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and profound insights generation. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression, this research provides a meticulous evaluation of spending behavior across diverse categories. It offers a methodical assessment of error metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2) score, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), to gauge the predictive performance of these models. Furthermore, the project extends its reach by assessing variations in spending patterns at the state level, elucidating local idiosyncrasies in financial behavior. The outcomes of this analysis are twofold. Firstly, it offers a valuable resource for financial institutions, retailers, government agencies, and researchers, furnishing actionable insights into credit card spending trends. Secondly, it exemplifies the potential of credit card transaction data as a rich source for predictive analytics, opening doors to a myriad of applications beyond financial domains, ranging from marketing optimization to carbon footprint analysis. This project underscores the significance of data-driven decision-making in today's data-abundant world and sets a precedent for harnessing credit card data's transformative potential. It encapsulates the essence of this distinctiveness, underlining how this research significantly contributes to our understanding of credit card data and its potential to inform and benefit both the public and relevant institutions.
